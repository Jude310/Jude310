# Jude

Hello, I'm Angel Jude Diones, a student of West Visayas State University.

I know how to code in C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, and R. I prefer C++ as my programming language.

One the side, I play video games and workout. I have a passion for martial arts, especially hand-to-hand combat. Sometimes, I play with musical instruments such as a keyboard, guitar, or drums.
